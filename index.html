        <p>Hey what’s up I’m Jonathan Thibeaux, I go by a few different names but mainly my last name. I attended Texas
          State University and my major was Electrical Engineering with a minor in mathematics. Although I may look as
          if I’m mixed with some Spanish or Arab, I’m just a young creole kid. I aspire to be a lot of things in life
          but
          still enjoying the journey on how to make everything come to fruition. Growing up I participated in many
          activities outside of school while maintaining above average grades. Having a purpose was something I began to
          be intrigued with at a very young age. I would sit around all the time and try to find the real reasons as to
          why I or anyone would do the things that they did. I quickly found out for me that anything that I wanted to
          do would require an extreme amount of passion if I was to be any good at it. The problem with me was that
          everything seemed attainable. I believed that I could be great at anything I set my mind to and I still do.
          This created a complex within my household which I shared with one older brother and one younger brother.
          Everyone seemed so sure of themselves and here I am still trying to figure everything out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My brothers picked their paths pretty early on; older brother chose basketball as a focus while my little
          brother decided to do
          track. These are things we chose to do outside of our academics which was always our primary focus. I was into
          sports and entertainment maybe the only two things that spark interest in a young black kid. Being interested
          in these activities are one thing, but being dedicated and good at them is an entirely different thing. I
          started off in theatre at the age of 7 at The Ensemble Theatre in Houston Texas. This is where I believe a lot
          of myself came from. From the Ensemble is where I got the urge to do music, acting, directing, or anything
          creative. I quickly decided that entertainment was something I could do for the rest of my life just because
          it was fun and helped others in ways nothing else can. I guess at the end of the day I want to use any of my
          intelligence, talent, and passion to help relate to others and to be an inspiration or just an example of a
          great human being.</p>
